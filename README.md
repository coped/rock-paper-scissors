# README:
This is a small JavaScript based game of rock, paper, scissors. To play, open the .html file in an internet browser.

The rules: Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

The player has a choice of selecting rock, paper, scissors for each round. Their choice is subsequently compared against a random computer input. The first player to reach a score of five, wins. To play again, refresh the page.

This program was created as a small project to test the author's understanding of basic JavaScript functions, conditionals, and DOM manipulation.
