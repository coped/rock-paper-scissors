README:
This is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors played through the browser console.

To play, open the .html file in an internet browser, and open the browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + J) for interactivity.

The rules: Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

The player is prompted for their input of rock, paper, scissors, which is subsequently compared against a random computer input.

Five rounds of rock, paper, scissors are played, and whoever has highest score at the end wins. To play again, refresh the page.

This program was created as a small project to test the author's understanding of basic javascript functions and conditionals.
